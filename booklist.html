		<p>
			I read books, and I'd like to keep track of them and share some opinions.
			Not that they have to be read by someone, but hey, here you go!
			For each book I provide a title, author, genre and page count,
			the official summary, my short opinion (with spoilers hidden until clicked),
			and whether I recommend it.
			When I find the right sites, the title of the book will be clickable to
			navigate to a page about it, same with the author.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm reading most of my books in Dutch, only some in English. When the
			book is available in English I'll use the English title, otherwise I'll
			use the Dutch title. I'll do my best to mention if there are translations
			available, which will be shown in a list like <code>NL - EN - ...</code>.

				<p class="description">
					The day after his wedding, Tomas wakes up alone. His wife is nowhere
					to be seen. When he walks the dog, the streets are frighteningly empty.
					Strangely enough, people are crowding at the community center. There,
					it turns out that a change of unprecedented proportions has taken
					place on earth. A change that everyone had seen coming, except Tomas.

				<div class="opinion">
					<p>
						This is one of the first dystopian novels I read in a while (maybe
						ever?), and some of the mechanics reminded me of
						'<a href="#to-sleep-in-a-sea-of-stars">To sleep in a see of stars</a>'.
						The writing style however did not match it at all, with shorter
						and more simplistic sentences. These do match the character of
						protagonist Tomas, but I find them lightly annoying.

						<summary>Spoilers</summary>
						<p>
							The plot itself really did surprise me. I - maybe na√Øvely -
							expected a good ending. It was however very sudden, and not
							a satisfying ending. It leaves an incomplete and eerie feeling,
							fitting the dystopian nature.
						</p>
					</details>

					<p class="recommend">
						Would I recommend this? Maybe, maybe not. It wasn't great, it wasn't
						bad, would not read again, but if I'd turn back time I would not
						avoid it.
