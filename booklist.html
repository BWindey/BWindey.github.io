							The end of the book really reminded me of <i>Lord of the Rings</i>,
							where Frodo sails off on a ship, exactly the end here.
							The end could have been no better, except for Eragon and Ayra:
							they finally seem to be comfortable around each other but have
							to part ways, knowing that they each have their responsibilities
							and will not see each other again (often?).

						I can only conclude this series with a song and a heartfelt wish
						to be able to linger more into Alagaësia. There are at the time of
						reading/writing two more books, but those will never fill that need
						- a feeling fitting with the books.
						Only one thing leaves me, and that is to recommend this song, listen
						to it when you concluded the books yourself, and let it guide you on

					Oaths sworn . . . loyalties tested . . . forces collide.

				<p class="description">
					It’s been only months since Eragon first uttered “brisingr,” the ancient
					language term for fire. Since then, he’s not only learned to create
					magic with words-he’s been challenged to his very core.
					Following the colossal battle against the Empire’s warriors on the
					Burning Plains, Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, have narrowly escaped
					with their lives. Still, there is more adventure at hand for the Rider
					and his dragon, as Eragon finds himself bound by a tangle of promises
					he may not be able to keep.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					First is Eragon’s oath to his cousin, Roran: to help rescue Roran’s
					beloved from King Galbatorix’s clutches. But Eragon owes his loyalty
					to others, too. The Varden are in desperate need of his talents and
					strength - as are the elves and dwarves. When unrest claims the rebels
					and danger strikes from every corner, Eragon must make choices
					- choices that will take him across the Empire and beyond,
					choices that may lead to unimagined sacrifice.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					Eragon is the greatest hope to rid the land of the tyranny. Can this
					once simple farm boy unite the rebel forces and defeat the king?
				</p>

				<div class="opinion">

						No need for many words, it's the same as book #2 but a bit better.
						I cannot wait to start the fourth book. I love the bond between

					Fifteen-year-old Eragon believes that he is merely a poor farm boy —

				<div class="opinion">
					<p>
						The author was 15 years old when he wrote this book, and that shows
						in his writing style in the first half of the book - or that's just
						the Dutch translator... . The story however captivated me.
						I've enjoyed reading another relatively simple fantasy book, and
						there are dragons! (I've missed those in other stories.)
					</p>

					<p>
						This book in particular also holds a dear place in my heart, as the
						will to read again rose again when seeing it somewhere online.
						I had to wait a while to begin reading it due to the next book in
						the series not being available yet in our local library - you can
						see all the books on the page below this one to see what I read
						while waiting; but it was worth the wait. Quite some hype,
						and the book kinda lives up to it. Not spectacularly good, but
						definitely not letting down.
					</p>

					<p class="recommend">
						Would I recommend this? Most definitely. It's a good read, and
						little spoiler: I'm in the next books already, and it does not
						disappoint. So go read!

					On the planet Talos VII, an anomaly is detected: a vast circular pit

					Not a book, but a thought
				</div>

				<p>
					After having read <a href="#witch-star">Wit'ch Star</a>, an observation
					has been observed about the endings of fantasy books. They seem to
					almost always leave behind a dual feeling of relief that the world
					has been saved from the bad, but at the same time a sadness, a void,
					from all the people and things that were lost on the way.
					It happened in <i>Wit'ch Star</i> and in
					<a href="#to-sleep-in-a-sea-of-stars">To Sleap in a Sea of Stars</a>
					(which technically is sci-fi but could as well be fantasy), both very
					similar in endings really. I'm sure it happened in other stories I've
					read, but my memory is not well enough. I'll focus on it once I finished
					another fantasy book.
				</p>

				<p>
					With this new insight, I must admit I'm dreading a little bit to start
					reading my next fantasy series, knowing that the ending will probably
					leave me in a sad mood for a little while. But, books deserve to be
					read, even if you know they don't end well.

					The three deadly Weirgates are destroyed, but the threat of the Dark
					Lord remains. And so Elena and her companions have gone their separate
					ways to prepare for what is yet to come. Elena herself has journeyed
					to the beautiful city of A'loa Glen, there to recover her strength and
					spirit. Enter Harequin Quail. Some might call him a fool, but the
					little main in the jester's suit claims to be a spy. And he comes
					fresh from the foul fortress of Blackhall itself, where the Dark Lord
					dwells. TThere he uncovered things that spell certain doom—for a final
					Weirgate remains, the most ppotent one of all. And with it, in just
					one moon's time, the Dark Lord will avenge his earlier defeat,
					destroying the heart of the land and ushering in a reign of evil
					without end. Only Elena, with the awesome magicks of the Blood Diary,
					has the power to stop him. Blackhall is all but impregnable. And
					according to Quail, the Weirgate is well hidden, in a place known only
					to the Dark Lord himself. Thus begins a desperate quest like no other.
					Hunted by the Dark Lord's minions and threatened by clandestine betrayals,
					Elena and her brave companions reunite in the effort to locate the
					last Weirgate and destroy it. Along the way, many questions will be
					answered and illusions will be smashed. Brother will turn against brother,
					and the strongest bonds of magic and love will be tested to the
					breaking point...and beyond.

						A worthy end to the story. Whenever I stopped reading to do something

					destroy the Gates, as windships carry the fight north to the frigid woodlands,
					south to the burning desert sands, and east to the blasted regions of
					dread Gul'gotha.
					Along the way, they will face their own personal demons as well. The
					twin brothers Mogweed and Fardale race against time to break the curse
					that has stolen their shape-changing birthright, and Elena's brother
					Joach must evade the desert sandsharks if he is to master his own
					elemental power. The trail will lead them even to the fabulous el'vin
					homeland of Stormhaven. None of the rebels will come back unscathed,
					some never returning at all...
					And Elena herself must journey to Gul'gotha. Daring the enemy's own lair,
					she must emerge victorious if she is to reveal the secret of the Dark
					Lord's frightening identity—and the shocking nature of his vast powers.

					In her hands, the young wit'ch Elena holds the awesome energies of
					blood magick-and more. For the fate of all, Alasea hinges on her
					recovery of the Blood Diary, a potent talisman forged five hundred
					years ago, then locked away behind wards too strong for any mage to break.
					But only with the secrets recorded in its pages can Elena defeat the
					evil magicks of the Dark Lord. The challenge? The Diary lies hidden in
					A'loa Glen, the fabled city that belongs to Shorkan, chief lieutenant
					of the Dark Lord, and his fearsom army.
					Now, with the aid of the ocean-dwelling Sy-wen and her great dragon,
					Elena prepares a desperate invasion of A'loa Glen. At her side stands
					the one-armed warrior Er'ril, her faithful protector and the only man
					who knows how to unlock the wards surrounding the Blood Diary— a man
					who also happens to be the brother of the dreaded Shorkan.
					Meanwhile, Elena's brother, whose magick brings him prophetic dreams,
					has glimpsed a future in which Elena falls by the deadly sword of...Er'ril.
					But his visions do not always come true. How can he act against his
					sister's trusted guardian on the basis of a future betrayal that may
					never happend? For Elena's sake, and for the sake of all Alasea,
					how can he afford not to?

				<div class="opinion">
					<p>
						I think that the story is going on full steam now. It's the third
						book in the five-part-series.
						I've not got much opinion to share, it's just a good book.
					</p>

					<p class="concern" id="banned-banished-concern">
						I do have a concern though. There is a tiny bit of romance, two
						forming couples, but eh, Mr. Clemens, why did you make them between
						an adult man and a girl? Two times? It's a bit off-putting.
						I understand that it otherwise would be harder for the story, but
						this book was released in the year 2000, not the year 1500.
					</p>

					<p class="recommend">
						Would I recommend this? If you read the second book, you have to
						read this third one, but I will put this on the 'not-again' list
						due to above reason. There is enough other literature that aligns
						better with my values. (I will also update the 'recommend' of the
						other parts of the series.)

					Elena bears the mark of the wit'ch upon her palm, the crimson stain
					that testifies to the awesome power of unimaginable potency: wild
					seductive, and difficult to control. Only a mistress of blood magick
					can stand against the foul minions and all-corrupting evil of the
					Dark Lord. But Elena is not yet the mistress of her magick.
					Protected by an ageless warrior and a band of renegades, she quests
					for a lost city where prophecies speak of a mystic tome that holds
					the key to the Dark Lord's defeat. But if the Dark Lord finds her first,
					Elena will become his most fearsome weapon. A different form of power
					touches Sy-wen, girl-child of an ocean-dwelling clan that bonds-mates
					to the terrible and majestic sea dragons. But bonds more ancient still
					tie Sy-wen to the land she does not know, to a man she has never seen...
					and to a legend asleep in stone deep beneath A'loa Glen-a legend
					beginning to wake. Now, as Elena and Sy-wen converge on A'loa Glen
					from land and sea, will the forces they unleash lead to a future of
					freedom-or an eternity under the Dark Lord's yoke?

						This is one of the first dystopian novels I read in a while (maybe

						'<a href="#to-sleep-in-a-sea-of-stars">To sleep in a see of stars</a>'.
						The writing style however did not match it at all, with shorter
						and more simplistic sentences. These do match the character of
						protagonist Tomas, but I find them lightly annoying.

							The plot itself really did surprise me. I - maybe naïvely -

					To Sleep in a Sea of Stars is a story of enormous intergalactic weight
					and consequence, but also of deeply personal human strength, compassion,
					and awe.

					During a routine survey mission on an uncolonized planet, xenobiologist
					Kira Navárez finds an alien relic that thrusts her into the wonders
					and nightmares of first contact. Epic space battles for the fate of
					humanity take her to the farthest reaches of the galaxy and, in the
					process, transform not only her—but the entire course of history.

							Only the end of the book left me a little bit disappointed.
