		<h1>BWindey's (blog) site</h1>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm a university student (computer science) and like to do some hobby
			programming on the side, nothing spectacular. Currently I like working
			with C and
			<a href="https://c3-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"> C3 </a>.
			Most - actually all at the point of writing - is stuff for the
			terminal, as I like my Linux terminal (
			<a href="https://voidlinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">
				Void Linux
			</a>).
		</p>

		<p>
			I'd like to use this little site to write down thoughts in article-form
			and use it as an excuse to experiment. Additionally it allows me to play
			a bit with HTML, CSS (and potentially a bit of JS). It already allowed me
			to patch a font! (Check your network tab when loading an article to see
			the size of the fonts.)
		</p>

		<h2>What can you find on this site?</h2>
		I'm aiming to write some articles about the stuff that I'm interested in,
		or about what I'm working on in my spare time. All articles will be listed
		below.
