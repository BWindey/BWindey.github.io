		<h1>Bash Completions</h1>
		<p>
			Working in the terminal is fun. Using commands to do actions can feel
			like magic sometimes, and only needing to rely on your keyboard lets you
			go fast.
			Tab completions are a big part of the magic of the commandline. They allow
			us to complete long flags or subcommands way faster, and can also serve as
			a discovery of the available flags and arguments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Good tab completions require an understanding of the command itself. This
			means that more complex CLIs will require more complex completion scripts,
			and perhaps the command even starts providing some subcommands or flags
			to help out the completion script by providing more info.
			But what if we take this idea even further, and just let the command do
			its own completion? It already has to do argument parsing, so it feels
			like it should be quite easy to add in a little bit of extra code to
			also allow completing its own arguments and flags.
