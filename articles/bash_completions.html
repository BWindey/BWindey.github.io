		<h1>Bash Completions</h1>
		<p>
			Working in the terminal is fun. Using commands to do actions can feel
			like magic sometimes, and only needing to rely on your keyboard lets you
			go fast.
			Tab completions are a big part of the magic of the commandline. They allow
			us to complete long flags or subcommands way faster, and can also serve as
			a discovery of the available flags and arguments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Good tab completions require an understanding of the command itself. This
			means that more complex CLIs will require more complex completion scripts,
			and perhaps the command even starts providing some subcommands or flags
			to help out the completion script by providing more info.
			But what if we take this idea even further, and just let the command do
			its own completion? It already has to do argument parsing, so it feels
			like it should be quite easy to add in a little bit of extra code to
			also allow completing its own arguments and flags.
		</p>

		<h2>A quick refresher on programmable Bash completions</h2>
		<p>
			When Bash calls on a completion script, it sets seven usefull environment
			variables:
			<pre>$1: name of command ('cat', 'ls', 'git', ...)
$2: current word being completed
$3: word before current word being completed

$COMP_WORDS: array of all words typed on commandline
$COMP_CWORD: amount of all words typed on commandline
$COMP_LINE: string of all words typed on commandline
$COMP_POINT: index in string where user-cursor is in $COMP_LINE</pre>
			See
			<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html">
				the Bash manual for programmable completions</a>
			and for
			<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Variables.html">
				set environment variables</a>
			for more information.

			For simple commands, it's often enough to only use <code>$2</code> and
			<code>$3</code>. More complex commands, where allowed values for arguments
			can change in the presence of some flags might need the <code>$COMP_...</code>
			family of environment variables.
			Note that Bash also allows you to use a command to do the completions with
			<code>compgen -C &lt;command&gt;</code>,
			but that limits the fun stuff we can do a bit, and also will be less
			shell-independent.
		</p>

		<h2>Theory of integrating completions</h2>
		<p>
			The main idea now is to adapt our command that we're writing completions
			for so that it gets a new subcommand (or flag, you choose how your CLI
			looks) which will take in 2 arguments; the first will be everything written
			on the commandline up to the cursor, the second will be the rest. The
			result of the completions will be written to standard output with one
			entry per line.
			Then all we need is a small wrapper-script written in Bash that will
			call upon the main command with these arguments:
			<!-- Code fragment generated using ':TOhtml' in (n)vim and modifying its classes -->
			<pre><span class="red">function</span> <span class="green bold">_complete_my_command</span><span class="orange">() {</span>
	<span class="red">local</span> first_part<span class="orange">=</span><span class="green">"</span><span class="orange">${COMP_LINE[</span><span class="green">:</span><span class="orange">$COMP_POINT]}</span><span class="green">"</span>
	<span class="red">local</span> second_part<span class="orange">=</span><span class="green">"</span><span class="orange">${COMP_LINE[$COMP_POINT</span><span class="green">:</span><span class="orange">]}</span><span class="green">"</span>
	<span class="orange">mapfile</span> <span class="blue">-t COMPREPLY</span> <span class="orange">&lt; &lt;(</span><span class="green">my_command</span> <span class="blue">complete</span> <span class="green">"</span><span class="orange">$</span>first_part<span class="green">" "</span><span class="orange">$</span>second_part<span class="green">"</span><span class="orange">)</span>
<span class="orange">}</span>

<span class="orange">compgen</span> <span class="blue">-F _complete_my_command my_command</span></pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now <code>my_command complete</code> can do its magic by inspecting
			both parts, analyzing context if needed, and print out what can be
			completed.
